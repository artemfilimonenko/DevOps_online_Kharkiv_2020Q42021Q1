## DevOps Introduction 
#### TASK 1.1 

The task was to create an account on GitHub, create a repo, then clone it to workstation and get acquainted with how to:
- create new branches;
- complete commits;
- push and pull repo;
- merge branches;
- resolve merging conflicts;
- see git logs.

On the screenshot below you may see my commits log:

Also, while I was facing conflict while merging branch "styles" into "develop", on the screenshot below is the solving:

In the end of the task I had such a branch tree:

In the file \m1\task1.1_GIT.txt I provide the log of my commits.

The final task was to describe what DevOps means.
*DevOps is a system development methodology that links Development and Operations. It provides CI/CD practices, IaC process, application security and reliability. DevOps engineer is a specialist which sets and maintains an infrastructure to implement this infrastructure.*

During this task I learned and practised with the major Git commands. Created my own repository and learned how to work with readme.md files.
